			<p>  My role on P3:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>I worked on a team of 5 students, managing a single repository and incorporating feedback from several playtests.</p></li>
				<li><p>I was the primary engine tool developer, 3D animator, and marketing lead on this Unity Game:</p></li>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Engine Tool Developer: I wrote the underlying C# scripting for the core game: level loading, grid-based logic, as well as abstract implementations of player and enemy movement.</p></li>
					<li><p>3D Animator: I produced the animations of the cat, rat, dog, and robot enemies (which I created in Blender then imported to Unity).</p></li>
					<li><p>Marketing: I published the game to four websites (IndieDB, TIGSource, Itchi, and GameJolt) alongside text blurbs, images, and a video trailer produced by fellow team members.</p></li>
				</ul>

				<li><p>As the sole developer for this Unity Game, I was responsible for the design, programming (C#), and aesthetics of the game.

				<p>  My role on P1:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Classic Game: I was responsible for most of the map-based logic, such as the room transitions, opening locked doors, spawning enemies, pushing blocks, and pathing over water tiles. I also implemented the bomb item and helped with the sound.</p></li>
